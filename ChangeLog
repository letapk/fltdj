19 June 2022 - Updated documentation.
17 Apr 2004 - Modified global search code to display journal or appointment on clicking the
			results list. Deleted "Show" button.
			Modified html doc file.
			Rebuilt 0.7rc1.
16 Apr 2004 - Sorting of contacts was broken in 0.7. Added sort_contacts while saving contact
			data.
			Display of note after global search mangles journal data. Fixed.
			Changed format of list entry after global search.
4 Apr 2004 - Added code in global search to get filename list in .fltdj directory, read and search
			the data and display results under global search tab in appt and noting column.
			Fixed a potential segfault while reading unallocated pointer (noting[0]) in journal
			file.
28 Mar 2004 - Splitting global search to a separate file.
21 Mar 2004 - Increased buffer for global search to fix segfault when lines are too
			long! Added line in searchlistshow_cb to jump to first instance of text
			found during global search.
			Buggy issue: phrase in global search leads to incorrect results. Traced to
			binary data associated with appointments, misleading grep to return wrong
			results ("Binary file matches").
			Changed name of lockfile to exclude it from global searches. The "-" was
			the culprit. Remember not include it in any  data filename.
			Fixed a strange bug in which the fortune command line was being displayed
			in the appointment number box. How things interact in weird ways. This was
			due to the commontext buffer being filled with the fortune command when
			the apptab was in the forground, and since the appt number also used the
			same buffer, this got displayed when an empty note was clicked on the
			calendar, and when the fortune option was turned on...
			Fixed.
			Remade targz package for rc1.
15 Jan 2004 - Made targz package for rc1. Not released yet.
               Modified makefile to link static executable. Needs two more
               libraries. Unzipped stripped binary is 1.8MB, as opposed to
               0.1MB for dynamic executable. Modified README. This is not in
               rc1.

               Added keyboard shortcuts. Modified the documentation.

               file name to read.

15 Oct 2003 - Modified datebutton fn in fltdjcal, to show note even when notes tab is in the

31 Aug 2003 - Modified display of note after search. Currentdaybuttonindex was not
			being assigned.

			to show the fortune, program will now save it (unless it is

		to inbuilt FLTK editor. Compiles. Segfaults! To fix.
27 Apr 2003 - Changed editor for todolist from fl_editor to inbuilt FLTK editor.
		Works, except for folding of line at edge of window. Users will
		just have to press return at end of line. This also does not add one
		extra line at end of file.
24 Mar 2003 - Added statement to redraw date button after adding an appointment.
		This was omitted earlier and buttons were not being shown
		depressed until redrawn later!
		Added a dummy Fl_Help Dialog, which is loaded with the help
		file, but not shown. This allows links and images to be visible
		in the helptab.

13 Mar 2003 - Added code to highlight current date and display associated note
		at program startup. Added shownote and getdayname functions.
		This program is getting more and more convoluted. Bad design and
		poor implementation.
		Resizing behaviour adjusted. Calendar controls do not change
		size, tabs do.
9 Mar 2003 - Cutting back auto-resize and related behaviour. The editor code
		hangs in reformatting when the editor window goes to 0!
  		Deleted some superfluous lines which saved data in holiday code.
		Added multitabs to project.
8 Mar 2003 - Added fltdjcal.cpp as a new file to the project and moved all
		calendar code there.
7 Mar 2003 - Added flag to signal state of tdj window (expanded/contracted).

26 Dec 2002 - Parsed the contents of results file. Perhaps complete?
24 Dec 2002 - Filled out the skeleton for global search. Using grep at present

5 Nov 2002 - Discovered bug in the code which sorts the contact info.
		Must have been there since version 0.6.4.
		OK, so nobody's perfect. But nobody's complained.
		So nobody's using this program! Is there any one out there?
		Fixed. Hopefully.
		Released as version 0.6.6, bugfix again.

8 July 2002 - Added code to sort the contact information alphabetically.
3 July 2002 - Added check for ~/.fltdj directory at start of program.
17 June 2002 - A segfault was being returned for the month of June 2002 when
		trying to move past the last note.
		The same segfault was detected for September 2001. While there
		may be others, nothing was detected for many of the other months.
		This happens when trying to go past the last note. This is due to
		an anomalous value of daybutton[i] for i=38, when the function
		should return at the end of the array. It segfaults instead when
		it goes past the end of the array! This is fixed by a kludge.
		This is another bugfix release. Version 0.6.3.
12 June 2002 - Editor was returning 1 character even when nothing was typed in. A
		kludge was added by checking CharacterCount as well as
		GetTextBufferSize in save_note_to_buffer. This is 0.6.2, a
		"bugfix" release. Wow.
